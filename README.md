# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock, Game
## Introduction
The game is an extended version of the well known Rock, Paper, Scissors game, just with an added twist. he game was originally created by Sam Kass with Karen Brylan, who intruduced two furhter variables into the game: 
a lizard and the character from the renowned TV series Star Trek, Spock. Even though it certainly gives the game a deeper meaning to be familiar with the character Spock and presumably makes it easier in the beginning to memorize the rules to play, it is not necessary to be able to play and enjoy the game.
The game was displayed on the TV sitcom The Big Bang Theory, after which it gained popularity.

How to play it: 
Both players choose one variable to place their bets similtaniously. When played in real life, the player's depict their choices by handsignals that each immitate the respective variable they represent, e.g. a fist represents a rock, the index and middle fingers form scissors, and so on, as depicted on the buttons in this javascript game. In this particular game, the user is playing against the computer, which is a randomly generated variable. This makes it impossible for the user to develop a strategy to foresee the oponont's choice based on his or her previous behaviour.

Rules: The winner is decided upon 
Each variable can beat or be beaten by two other variables as follows:
Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
Rock crushes Lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes Scissors
Scissors decapitates Lizard
Lizard eats Paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes Rock
Rock crushes Scissors
